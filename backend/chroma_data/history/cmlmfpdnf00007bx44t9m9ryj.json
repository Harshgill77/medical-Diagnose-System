How high is your fever, and how are you measuring it (e.g., thermometer)?\n2. Do you have any other symptoms, such as a cough, sore throat, body aches, or chills?\n3. How long have you been experiencing the fever?\n\nUnderstanding these details can help determine the next steps. If your fever is very high (above 103°F or 39.4°C) or if you're experiencing severe symptoms, it would be wise to seek medical attention. Otherwise, staying hydrated and resting are generally good practices. Let me know more about your situation!",
